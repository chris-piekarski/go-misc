*Branch: Rework go code to have a workspace to work with v1.1

Author: @c_piekarski
Date: 7/26/2011
Purpose: Learning go. This repo (goMisc) is a small collection of my first Go code ever. The "requirments" are located at the end of Day1 and Day2 slides located at $(GOROOT)/doc/*.pdf. The concurrent Pell package is one I made up to help learn the content in Day3.

To build and run fibo:
cd ./fibo
make && make install
cd ../
6g calcfibo.go
6l calcfibo.6
./6.out

To build and run myHttp:
cd ./myHttp
make && make install
cd ../
6g myServer.go
6l myServer.6
./6.out

To build and run Pell:
cd ./pell
make && make install
cd ../
6g calcpell.go
6l calcpell.6
./6.out

To test the packages use:
cd ./myHttp OR ./fibo OR ./pell
gotest -v

To run the benchmark tests use:
cd ./myHttp
gotest -v -bench=.
