Purpose: Learning go. This repo (goMisc) is a small collection of my first Go code ever. The "requirments" are located at the end of Day1 and Day2 slides located at $(GOROOT)/doc/*.pdf. The concurrent Pell package is one I made up to help learn the content in Day3.

Date: 6/27/2013
Rework: Work with new Go v1.1

To build and run fibo:
go install github.com/fibo
go install github.com/mains/calcfibo
calcfibo

To build and run myHttp:
go install github.com/myHttp
go install github.com/mains/myServer

To build and run Pell:
go install github.com/pell
go isntall github.com/mains/calcpell
calcpell

To test the packages use:
cd src/github.com/myHttp OR src/github.com/fibo OR src/github.com/pell
go test

To run the benchmark tests use:
cd src/github.com/myHttp
go test -bench=.
